# Icon Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the add-on icon. In a real implementation, you would want to create a proper PNG image file named "icon.png" with dimensions of 128x128 pixels.

The icon should represent the openpilot installer generator and be visually appealing in the Home Assistant add-on store.

Suggested icon elements:
- A car symbol
- The openpilot logo
- Installation/download iconography

Replace this file with a real icon.png before publishing the add-on.
